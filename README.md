# Off I go
**The journey planning platform for peopled with a condition or impairment**

As my fifth and last Portfolio project with Code Institute, I built this content sharing platform with Django REST Framework and React.

**Off I go** is made with disabled people in mind, to share advice with each other and find information on accessible features of a given site/service as the user plans their journey.

Social Users - Predominantly Disabled people and people with a condition or impairment that use our platform to plan their journey, can customise their feeds for posts that are most relevant to their needs, interests and location.

Service Providers - Verified official users that can provide information of their sites and services, some examples:
 - TfL (Transport for London) - could create and update posts for a given station, detailing accessible entries/exits, available ramps and toilets or how to get assistance.
 - A restaurant or franchise - could create and update posts regarding their restaurant accessible features.

Support Providers - Verified official users that can provide information to:
  - social users on travelling for work or leisure, rights and how to manage common obstacles.
  - service providers on how they can offer better services for the social users.
